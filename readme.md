# 🧠 Vibe Coding with GitHub Copilot

Welcome to **Vibe Coding with GitHub Copilot** — a creative journey from basic web components to a deployed Next.js app, powered by AI-driven development.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project started as a hands-on experiment with **GitHub Copilot in Agent Mode**, embracing a vibe-driven, exploratory coding process. Here's how it evolved:

   Created a simple yet functional **Calculator App** using the basics of web development, guided interactively by Copilot.

2. **🔁 Escalation to Next.js**  
   Expanded the scope by transitioning to **Next.js** for a modern, component-based development experience.

3. **🎮 Snake Game Development**  
   Leveraged the power of React and Next.js to create a playable **Snake Game** — adding interactivity and fun.

4. **⚙️ Deployment Preparation**  
   Refined the codebase, resolved build configurations, and prepared the app for deployment.

5. **🌐 Live on Vercel**  
   Successfully deployed on **Vercel**:
